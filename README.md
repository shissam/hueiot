# hueiot: Follow the sun and activities to control Philips Hue lights.

# Background

I am certainly thrilled with IoT, but I prefer to keep as much as I can within the 'firewall'. This suite of ```bash``` scripts managed were built under Ubuntu/Raspbian on a low power Raspberry Pi for 24-7/365 management of the Philips Hue lights in the home.

# Usage
